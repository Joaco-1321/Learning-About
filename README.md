# Learning About

Welcome to **Learning About**. This GitHub repository is dedicated to my personal project-based learning journey in the field of Computer Science. By documenting my progress and insights here, I aim to deepen my understanding of various topics and provide a resource for others interested in my learning process.

## Introduction

Learning is a continuous process, particularly in the ever-evolving field of Computer Science. This repository serves as a digital journal of my exploration and experimentation with different concepts, technologies, and tools within the realm of Computer Science.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to explore my learning journey or follow along as I delve into various topics, feel free to do so! Here are the general steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Joaco-1321/Learning-About.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to a Topic**: Enter the specific topic folder you're interested in:

    ```bash
    cd Learning-About/Fundamentals/
    ```

3. **Choose a Subtopic**: inside the topic folder, you'll find various subtopics.

    ```bash
    ls
    Programming-Basics/  Data-Structures/  Algorithms/
    ```

4. **Explore**: To explore a specific subtopic, you can follow these steps:
    - Inside each subtopic, you'll find a **Code** folder, where you can explore code examples in various programming languages.

    - There's also a **README.md** file providing an overview of the subtopic.

    - Depending on the subtopic, you may find additional folders for **Exercises** or **Projects** related to that topic.

    ```bash
    ls
    README.md  Code  Exercises
    ```
## Future Considerations

Please note that the structure of topics within this repository may evolve over time. Topics can be part of a bigger topic, which is why I'm considering the structure carefully. This allows for a flexible and hierarchical organization that reflects the interrelated nature of various subjects within Computer Science. Feel free to check back periodically for updates and new content.
